# AI Habitat Testing Strategy & Implementation

## Sprint 8 Implementation Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and stability infrastructure implemented for the AI Habitat project, as specified in Sprint 8 of the CLAUDE.md requirements.

## ✅ Completed Requirements

### 1. Vitest Testing Infrastructure
- **Migrated from Jest to Vitest** with happy-dom environment
- **Modern testing setup** with TypeScript support and ES modules
- **Custom test utilities** with deterministic seeding (seed: 12345)
- **Coverage thresholds** set to >80% for core systems

### 2. Unit Tests for Core Systems

#### Rule Engine Tests (`src/test/policies/RuleEngine.test.ts`)
- ✅ **26 comprehensive test cases** covering:
  - Basic rule evaluation and caching
  - Predicate evaluation (time, temperature, device types)
  - Conflict detection and resolution
  - Utility scoring and priority resolution
  - Time and season logic
  - Action target mapping
  - Edge cases and error handling

#### World Store Tests (`src/test/sim/worldStore.test.ts`)
- ✅ **Comprehensive state management testing**:
  - Initial state validation
  - Simulation control (start/pause/step)
  - Room variable management with safety limits
  - Device lifecycle management
  - Action application with constraints
  - Health and harmony calculations
  - Event logging and management

#### Performance Monitor Tests (`src/test/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.test.ts`)
- ✅ **Performance tracking validation**:
  - Tick performance monitoring
  - LLM response time tracking
  - Frame rate monitoring
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Performance budget enforcement
  - Warning system functionality

### 3. Required Specific Test Scenarios

All three Sprint 8 mandated scenarios are implemented and tested:

#### ✅ Scenario 1: "AC cools vs Heater warms → Safety range enforcement wins"
```typescript
it('should prioritize safety when temperature approaches limits', () => {
  // Tests safety priority in conflict resolution
  // Verifies AC wins over heater when temperature near 26°C limit
  // Validates hard constraints enforcement
})
```

#### ✅ Scenario 2: "Quiet hours: lights lose to monitor at night"
```typescript
it('should enforce quiet hours priority - monitor beats lamp', () => {
  // Tests time-based rule enforcement
  // Verifies health monitor priority during quiet hours (22:00-07:00)
  // Validates soft constraint application to lighting
})
```

#### ✅ Scenario 3: "Comms block: fridge cannot message coffee maker"
```typescript
it('should block communication between fridge and coffee maker', () => {
  // Tests communication rule enforcement
  // Verifies negative action hints prevent messaging
  // Validates selective communication blocking
})
```

### 4. Integration Tests (`src/test/integration/SimulationFlow.test.ts`)
- ✅ **End-to-end simulation flow testing**
- ✅ **Multi-device scenario validation**
- ✅ **Emergency and cascading conflict handling**
- ✅ **State consistency across simulation steps**
- ✅ **Performance and scalability testing**

### 5. Deterministic Testing
- ✅ **Seeded randomness** (seed: 12345) for reproducible tests
- ✅ **Fixed random mocks** for consistent behavior
- ✅ **Deterministic conflict resolution** validation
- ✅ **Time-based scenario control**

### 6. Performance Monitoring & Telemetry

#### Real-time Performance Monitor (`src/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.ts`)
- ✅ **Comprehensive metrics tracking**:
  - Simulation tick rates and timing
  - LLM response latencies
  - Memory and CPU usage
  - Frame rate monitoring
  - Network latency tracking

#### Visual Telemetry Overlay (`src/ui/TelemetryOverlay.tsx`)
- ✅ **Real-time metrics display**
- ✅ **Performance warnings system**
- ✅ **Budget enforcement alerts**
- ✅ **Interactive controls and reports**

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

#### GitHub Actions Workflows
- ✅ **Main CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  - Multi-node version testing (18.x, 20.x)
  - Type checking and linting
  - Test execution with coverage
  - Build verification
  - Security auditing
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Automated deployments

- ✅ **Performance Monitoring** (`.github/workflows/performance-monitoring.yml`):
  - Daily performance checks
  - Lighthouse audits
  - Bundle size analysis
  - Performance budget validation

#### Quality Gates
- ✅ **Coverage thresholds**: >80% for core systems (85% for policies/ and sim/)
- ✅ **Performance budgets**: Tick time, LLM latency, memory, FPS limits
- ✅ **Security scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Code quality**: ESLint with zero warnings policy

- Extended expect interface for domain-specific testing

### Performance Budgets
```typescript
const budgets = {
  maxTickTime: 500,        // 500ms max per tick
  minTickRate: 0.08,       // At least 1 tick per 12.5 seconds
  maxLlmResponseTime: 3000, // 3 seconds max LLM response
  maxMemoryUsage: 256,     // 256MB max memory
  minFps: 30               // 30 FPS minimum
}
```

## Running the Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test
