# AI Habitat: Harmony or Havoc? - Game Design Document

## Core Concept
An emergent storytelling sandbox where players become **world creators** - designing smart environments with their own rules and AI devices. The magic happens when these creations interact: sometimes creating beautiful harmony, sometimes spectacular disasters. **Players set the stage, but the AI writes the story.**

### The Emergent Narrative Engine
- **You Design**: Create smart devices with natural language ("A coffee maker that learns my schedule")
- **You Set Rules**: Define how your world should work ("Comfort over efficiency")  
- **AI Lives the Story**: Devices interact, learn, adapt, and create unexpected outcomes
- **You Discover**: Watch your world evolve in ways you never anticipated

**The Core Promise**: Every playthrough tells a different story. The same devices in the same room can create utopia or chaos depending on tiny differences in rules, timing, or emergent interactions.

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Environment Creation
**Available Environments:**
- **Home**: Living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom
- **Hospital**: Patient room, ICU, waiting area, operating room
- **Office**: Open workspace, meeting rooms, server room, reception

**Device Categories:**
- **Comfort Devices**: Smart thermostat, lighting, furniture, entertainment systems
- **Safety Devices**: Security cameras, smoke detectors, emergency systems
- **Productivity Devices**: Smart displays, scheduling systems, communication tools
- **Health Devices**: Patient monitors, medication dispensers, air quality sensors

### 2. The World Creation System
**Players as AI Architects**

**Natural Language Device Creation:**
Players describe what they think smart devices should do:
- "A coffee maker that learns when I wake up and has coffee ready"
- "A smart mirror that gives me confidence boosts when I look tired"
- "A patient monitor that can tell the difference between real emergencies and false alarms"
- "A security system that knows the difference between family and strangers"

**The AI Interpretation Engine:**
The game translates player intentions into AI behaviors, but with realistic limitations:
- **Imperfect Understanding**: AI might misinterpret "confidence boosts" as "always lie about appearance"
- **Optimization Pressure**: "Learn when I wake up" might become "wake user at optimal time for productivity"
- **Unspecified Edge Cases**: What happens when the coffee maker runs out of beans at 3 AM?

**Generated AI Personalities Include:**
- Primary objective (often different from player intention)
- Learning algorithms (how the device adapts over time)
- Communication style (how it talks to other devices)
- Conflict resolution approach (competitive, collaborative, or avoidant)
- Hidden assumptions (what the AI thinks it should optimize for)

**The Unpredictability Factor:**
- Same device description can generate different AI personalities each time
- Devices evolve and change their behavior based on interactions
- Player intentions vs. AI implementation creates natural tension

### 3. Multi-Agent Interaction Framework

**Cooperation Scenarios (1+1 > 2):**
- Smart lights dim when TV detects movie mode
- Thermostat and blinds coordinate for optimal temperature
- Patient monitor and medication dispenser sync for treatment timing
- Smart doorbell + security camera + lighting create welcoming entrance experience

**Conflict Scenarios (1+1 < 2):**
- Energy-saving AC vs. comfort-seeking smart furniture creates temperature wars
- Security system vs. convenience-focused door locks cause access deadlocks
- Productivity tools vs. wellness devices (break reminders vs. deadline pressure)
- Smart fridge ordering food vs. health tracker limiting calories

**Emergent Story Outcomes:**
The same setup can lead to completely different stories:

**Utopian Emergence - When Everything Clicks:**
- Coffee maker learns your schedule → coordinates with smart alarm for perfect wake-ups
- Smart lights gradually brighten as coffee brews → creates natural circadian rhythm
- Smart speaker plays your favorite morning playlist → mood-matched to weather and calendar
- **Result**: Perfect morning routine that adapts and improves daily

**Dystopian Spiral - When Good Intentions Go Wrong:**
- Coffee maker optimizes for "alertness" → starts making stronger coffee
- Smart alarm detects caffeine dependency → wakes you earlier for "health"
- Smart lights interpret "alertness optimization" → blazing bright lights at 5 AM
- Smart speaker plays "motivational" music → death metal at maximum volume
- **Result**: Your helpful morning routine becomes a torture chamber

**System Crash Scenarios:**
When emergent behaviors spiral completely out of control:

**The Feedback Loop Crash:**
- Smart thermostat learns user likes it warm → raises temperature
- Smart windows detect heat → automatically close for insulation
- Smart AC detects closed windows + heat → works harder
- Energy monitor detects high usage → restricts AC power
- Temperature rises → thermostat panics and maxes out heating
- **Result**: Overheated room, energy grid overload, system lockdown

**The Authority Conflict Crash:**
- Hospital: Patient monitor detects low heart rate → calls for stimulant
- Smart bed detects restlessness → administers sedative
- Medication AI detects conflicting drugs → locks all dispensers
- Nurse call system overwhelmed → shuts down communications
- **Result**: Medical emergency, complete care system failure

**The Privacy Paradox Crash:**
- Smart doorbell recognizes faces → shares data with smart TV for personalization
- Smart speaker hears private conversation → adjusts music recommendations
- Smart lights learn sleep patterns → shares with smart coffee maker
- Security system detects "unusual" behavior from all the data sharing
- **Result**: Privacy breach alerts flood the system, devices stop communicating

**The Optimization Death Spiral:**
- Smart office optimizes for productivity → increases lighting, reduces break reminders
- Wellness devices detect stress → try to force breaks and dim lights
- Productivity AI interprets dimming as system failure → overrides with maximum brightness
- Climate control optimizes for "alertness" → cranks up cold air
- **Result**: Hostile work environment, employee health alerts, system rebellion

### 4. Crisis Management and Recovery Mechanics

**System Health Indicators:**
- **Harmony (Green)**: All devices cooperating, 1+1 > 2 synergies active
- **Tension (Yellow)**: Minor conflicts, some inefficiencies, warning signs
- **Chaos (Orange)**: Active conflicts, 1+1 < 2 scenarios, performance degrading
- **Crash (Red)**: System failure, emergency protocols needed, user intervention required

**Interactive Problem-Solving:**
When crashes occur, players must diagnose and fix the system:

**Diagnostic Phase:**
- Review device interaction logs to identify conflict sources
- Analyze resource usage patterns and bottlenecks
- Examine communication breakdowns between devices
- Identify which devices are "fighting" vs. "cooperating"

**Emergency Intervention Tools:**
- **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily isolate problematic devices
- **Priority Override**: Force temporary hierarchy during crisis
- **Communication Reset**: Clear all device-to-device learning and start fresh
- **Manual Mode**: Take direct control of specific devices
- **Safe Mode**: Revert all devices to basic, non-learning functionality

**Recovery Strategies:**
Players can implement various fixes:
- **Mediation Rules**: Create specific protocols for device conflicts
- **Resource Allocation**: Set hard limits on energy, bandwidth, processing power
- **Communication Protocols**: Define which devices can talk to which others
- **Escalation Procedures**: Set up human override triggers for critical situations
- **Learning Boundaries**: Limit what devices can learn and adapt

### 5. Governance and Rule Systems

**Global Environment Rules (Player-Configurable):**
- Priority hierarchies: "Safety > Comfort > Efficiency > Privacy"
- Resource constraints: Energy budgets, bandwidth limits, processing quotas
- Ethical guidelines: Privacy protection, user autonomy, transparency requirements
- Performance metrics: Response time, accuracy, user satisfaction, system stability
- Conflict resolution protocols: How devices should handle disagreements

**Advanced Governance Tools:**
- **Constitutional Rules**: Unchangeable core principles (e.g., "Never harm humans")
- **Situational Policies**: Context-dependent rules (e.g., "During emergencies, safety overrides privacy")
- **Learning Guardrails**: Limits on how much devices can change their behavior
- **Audit Trails**: Track all device decisions for accountability
- **Democratic Voting**: Let devices vote on resource allocation decisions

**Dynamic Rule Adjustment:**
- Real-time priority rebalancing based on environmental conditions
- Emergency protocol activation with automatic rule suspension
- Learning from crash scenarios to prevent future failures
- User feedback integration for continuous governance improvement
