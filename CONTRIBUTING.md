Contributing to AI Habitat

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is an educational sandbox game for exploring AI alignment. Contributions are welcome across code, content, docs, and tests.

Getting Started
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Node.js 18+ required. Install deps with `npm install`.
- Run locally with `npm run dev` and open the printed URL.

Code Style
- TypeScript preferred. Keep changes focused and small.
- Lint/format before pushing: `npx eslint .` (if configured) and ensure TypeScript compiles: `tsc -noEmit`.

Testing
- Run unit/integration tests: `npm test` or `npm run test:watch`.
- Add tests for new logic, especially in `src/sim`, `src/policies`, and `src/simulation`.

Pull Requests
- Write a clear title and description (what/why/how, screenshots if UI changes).
- Reference related issues.
- Keep PRs scoped; prefer multiple small PRs over one large.

Issue Reporting
- Use descriptive titles, repro steps, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.
- For proposals, outline motivation, alternatives considered, and expected impact.
