# Design Document

## Overview

AI Habitat is a 2.5D isometric game where players create and manage smart environments filled with AI devices that come to life with personalities, goals, and quirks. The game combines intuitive drag-and-drop gameplay with deep emergent storytelling as players watch their AI creations interact, cooperate, conflict, and sometimes spectacularly malfunction.

The system consists of six core components: the Game Engine for 2.5D rendering and user interaction, the Natural Language Processing Engine for device creation, the Multi-Agent Simulation Framework for AI behavior, the Interaction Management System for device communication, the Crisis Detection System for dramatic failure scenarios, and the Game UI System for intuitive player controls and feedback.

The architecture prioritizes engaging gameplay and visual storytelling while maintaining educational depth. Players experience AI concepts through immediate visual feedback, character-like device personalities, and dramatic story moments rather than abstract technical concepts.
