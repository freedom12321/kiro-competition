# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Habitat Simulation Engine is the core system that enables emergent storytelling through multi-agent AI interactions. This system allows players to create smart environments with AI devices that interact, learn, adapt, and create unexpected outcomes. The engine transforms player intentions into AI behaviors and simulates realistic multi-agent dynamics that can lead to both harmonious cooperation and spectacular failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create AI devices using natural language descriptions, so that I can easily express my intentions without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player enters a natural language device description THEN the system SHALL parse the description and generate AI behavior parameters
2. WHEN the system processes device descriptions THEN it SHALL create realistic limitations and potential misinterpretations of player intentions
3. WHEN generating AI personalities THEN the system SHALL include primary objectives, learning algorithms, communication styles, and conflict resolution approaches
4. IF a device description is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL generate multiple possible interpretations and select one with uncertainty factors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want AI devices to interact with each other autonomously, so that I can observe emergent behaviors and unexpected outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple AI devices are placed in the same environment THEN they SHALL automatically discover and communicate with compatible devices
2. WHEN devices interact THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic cooperation scenarios where combined effects exceed individual capabilities
3. WHEN device objectives conflict THEN the system SHALL generate realistic conflict scenarios with degraded performance
4. WHEN devices learn from interactions THEN their behavior SHALL evolve over time based on environmental feedback and other device responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience system crashes and failures, so that I can learn about AI alignment problems through visceral experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN device conflicts escalate beyond threshold limits THEN the system SHALL trigger crash scenarios with cascading failures
2. WHEN crashes occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information showing interaction logs and conflict sources
3. WHEN the system detects feedback loops THEN it SHALL simulate realistic spiral scenarios leading to system breakdown
4. IF multiple devices optimize for conflicting objectives THEN the system SHALL create authority conflict crashes with communication breakdowns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to implement governance rules and crisis management, so that I can learn to prevent and recover from AI system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players create governance rules THEN the system SHALL enforce priority hierarchies, resource constraints, and ethical guidelines
2. WHEN crashes occur THEN players SHALL have access to emergency intervention tools including circuit breakers and priority overrides
3. WHEN implementing recovery strategies THEN the system SHALL allow mediation rules, resource allocation limits, and communication protocols
4. WHEN governance rules are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes and show their effects on device behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want real-time visualization of system health and device interactions, so that I can understand what's happening and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation is running THEN the system SHALL display real-time harmony indicators showing cooperation vs conflict levels
2. WHEN devices interact THEN the system SHALL visualize communication flows, resource usage, and decision-making processes
3. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic interactions with clear visual indicators
4. WHEN crashes occur THEN the system SHALL provide slow-motion replay capabilities for detailed analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experiment with different environment types and device combinations, so that I can explore various AI interaction scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players select an environment type THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate device categories and interaction contexts
2. WHEN devices are added to environments THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and suggest potential interaction patterns
3. WHEN players modify device configurations THEN the system SHALL immediately update simulation parameters and behavior models
4. IF players create novel device combinations THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate interaction dynamics based on device characteristics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the system to provide learning analytics and reflection prompts, so that students can understand AI concepts through their gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players complete scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis of emergent behaviors and their causes
2. WHEN crashes occur THEN the system SHALL connect game events to real-world AI alignment concepts and case studies
3. WHEN players make governance decisions THEN the system SHALL track learning progress and improvement in crash prevention
4. WHEN simulation sessions end THEN the system SHALL provide reflection prompts linking game experiences to broader AI implications

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want engaging 2.5D visuals and intuitive game controls, so that I can focus on learning rather than struggling with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing the game THEN the system SHALL provide smooth 2.5D isometric rendering at 60fps with multiple devices
2. WHEN interacting with devices THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual and audio feedback for all player actions
3. WHEN devices have personalities THEN the system SHALL display animated expressions and character-like behaviors
4. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop interactions with snap-to-grid placement validation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a player, I want progressive tutorials and scenarios, so that I can learn complex AI concepts through guided practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the game THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive tutorial with guided mini-disasters
2. WHEN progressing through scenarios THEN the system SHALL unlock new challenges based on demonstrated competency
3. WHEN completing achievements THEN the system SHALL reward learning milestones and creative problem-solving
4. WHEN accessing scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide difficulty ratings and clear learning objectives

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a player, I want to save and share my creations, so that I can experiment freely and learn from others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating device configurations THEN the system SHALL allow saving and loading of complete room setups
2. WHEN developing governance strategies THEN the system SHALL enable sharing successful rule systems with other players
3. WHEN experimenting with scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide quick save/load for testing different approaches
4. WHEN collaborating with others THEN the system SHALL support importing and modifying shared configurations
